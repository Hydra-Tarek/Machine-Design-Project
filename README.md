ðŸ“Œ Lead Screw Design for Lathe Machine

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and optimizing a lead screw for a lathe machine, ensuring precision, durability, and efficiency. The study evaluates different thread profiles (Square, ACME, Trapezoidal) and material choices (AISI 316L, AISI 304H, AISI 1020) using Fusion 360 for modeling and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for stress simulations.

- Graphs & Figures: Visual comparison of different designs
- Final Optimized Design: Selected lead screw configuration

## Objectives
- Design an efficient lead screw for a lathe machine
- Analyze different thread profiles and materials
- Use stress & torque analysis to optimize performance
- Develop a CAD model & prototype for testing

## Tools & Software
- Fusion 360 â€“ CAD modeling and FEA simulations
- MATLAB/Python (if applicable) â€“ Data processing and calculations
- ANSYS (Optional) â€“ For advanced CFD and structural analysis

## Key Findings
- Trapezoidal thread profile outperformed Square and ACME in terms of stress distribution and torque transmission
- 10mm diameter, 2mm pitch Trapezoidal thread was selected as the optimal design
- AISI 316L showed better fatigue resistance compared to other materials
- The lead screw prototype was fabricated using a lathe machine for real-world testing

## Future Improvements
- Conduct real-world testing for further validation
- Use Ball Screws instead of traditional lead screws for higher precision
- Perform ANSYS simulations for more detailed stress and load distribution analysis
